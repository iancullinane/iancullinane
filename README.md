# Ian Cullinane

🛰️ Currently working on platform tooling and deployments for WB Games Boston.

In my free time I work on games using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), build deployments on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/), and study things like philosophy, art, and whatever.

I blog at [iancullinane.com](https://www.iancullinane.com) about life, software, screen-printing, and more.

🏡 I live in [Sudbury, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury,_Massachusetts).
